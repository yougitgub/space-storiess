export const auroraScript = `It was a winter of sharp cold in northern Norway. Snow covered the land like an endless white page. The whole family gathered inside a small wooden cabin, and around the fireplace, the logs crackled warmly, filling the room with heat.

After dinner, they all went outside to glance at the night sky. But this night was different. Green and violet lights swirled above their heads, moving slowly like heavenly curtains breathing with the wind.

“Wow!” shouted Salma, Layla’s little sister.
“Look at the colors! Green… violet… and even red!”

Ahmed, their 10-year-old cousin, held his grandfather’s hand tightly and asked:
— “Grandpa, is this what they call the Northern Lights?”

The old man smiled, lifting his head to the sky as though reading from a familiar book:
— “Yes, Ahmed. But do you know something important? These lights are not just pretty colors. They are a message… sent from the Sun itself!”

The children quickly gathered around him, their voices overlapping with endless questions. Layla stepped forward curiously:
— “A message from the Sun? What do you mean?”

The grandfather sat on an old wooden chair, his voice blending with the crackle of the fire:
— “The Sun isn’t a calm ball in the sky. It’s a boiling star. Every minute, massive explosions erupt—called Solar Flares. And sometimes, the Sun throws out giant clouds of plasma, called Coronal Mass Ejections. All of this energy travels through space… reaching us at speeds of nearly a million miles per hour!”

Kareem, the youngest, giggled and said innocently:
— “A million miles an hour? That’s like 100 times faster than racing cars!”

They all laughed, but the grandfather raised his brows seriously:
— “Exactly! And that’s what we call Space Weather. Sometimes it’s calm, but sometimes it’s powerful enough to change our lives.”

Salma raised her hand like a schoolgirl:
— “But the colors in the sky… what makes them?”

The grandfather smiled, pointing upward:
— “When charged particles from the Sun reach Earth, our magnetic field guides them toward the poles—north and south. There, they collide with oxygen and nitrogen atoms. Oxygen at lower altitudes glows green, at higher altitudes it glows rare red. Nitrogen sometimes shines violet or blue.”

📊 (NASA Data):

Oxygen at 100–150 km → Green

Oxygen at 200–300 km → Rare red

Nitrogen → Violet/Blue


Ahmed’s eyes widened with wonder:
— “So every color tells a story?!”

The grandfather chuckled, patting his shoulder:
— “Exactly… every color is a clue about the gas and its altitude. It’s like Earth painting with the Sun’s light.”

For a moment, silence fell. Everyone gazed at the sky in awe. But Layla, her voice tinged with worry, asked:
— “Grandpa… what’s happening up there… could it affect us down here? Our homes, our lives?”

The old man pulled his chair closer, lowering his voice as though sharing a secret:
— “You know… once, the Sun sent a storm so powerful that in a faraway country—Canada—the lights went out completely. Power stations failed, and hospitals and homes were thrown into darkness. It wasn’t a war. It was space weather.”

The children exchanged stunned looks. Ahmed shook his head:
— “How? The Sun sends something across millions of kilometers… and it can turn off our lights?”

The grandfather laughed softly:
— “Yes, my boy! Those solar particles can sometimes enter power grids, creating enormous currents—like a massive electric shock. And sometimes, the networks can’t handle it.”

Salma leaned in curiously:
— “And what about satellites up there—the ones that take pictures of Earth?”

The grandfather nodded:
— “Ah… they’re the most vulnerable. Solar storms hit satellites directly. If they fail, we lose GPS, the internet, and communications. Imagine the world without the internet for just one day!”

The kids burst into laughter, but Layla frowned seriously:
— “That would be a disaster, Grandpa!”

The grandfather smiled:
— “And there’s more. Airplanes flying over the North Pole sometimes change their routes, because the radiation there becomes dangerously high, risking the passengers. Even radio signals used by pilots sometimes get cut off.”

He paused briefly, drawing them closer with suspense:
— “But the most at risk… are astronauts. Those living on the space station are exposed to dangerous radiation during solar storms. That’s why NASA issues alerts, guiding them into shielded areas inside the spacecraft.”

The children’s faces reflected fear, awe, and imagination. Salma whispered softly:
— “So these lights… aren’t just beautiful. They could change our lives down here.”

The grandfather gazed at her kindly, patting her shoulder:
— “Exactly. That’s why scientists don’t just admire the sky… they work day and night to protect us from the Sun’s secrets.”

Ahmed raised his hand excitedly, like in a science class:
— “Grandpa, are all solar storms like this? Or are there really huge ones?”

The grandfather sighed deeply, his voice lowering with weight:
— “Not all storms are the same. Some are small and harmless. But sometimes… the Sun gets angry. And when it does, it unleashes massive storms. Scientists call them Strong Solar Storms.”

Layla stepped closer, eyes filled with curiosity:
— “Like what?”

The grandfather waved his hand in the air, painting the image:
— “Let me tell you a story from long ago… In 1859, the strongest solar storm in recorded history happened. It’s called the Carrington Event. Telegraph wires—the lifeline of communication at the time—caught fire! Sparks flew from the lines, and some machines burned out. People saw the aurora in places it had never appeared before—Mexico, India…”

The children gasped:
— “Telegraph wires on fire?!!”

The old man nodded:
— “Yes. And that’s an old story. But even recently—in May 2024—a powerful G5 storm struck. It came from a solar flare called X8.7—one of the strongest possible. That storm made auroras visible in strange places—like Texas in the U.S., and even parts of Europe that never see them!”

Ahmed jumped with excitement:
— “So if the Sun gets angry, we could see auroras anywhere?!”

The grandfather chuckled:
— “Yes… but the problem isn’t the view. It’s what comes with it. Strong storms can disrupt satellites, damage electricity grids, and confuse navigation systems.”

Layla raised her brows seriously:
— “So if one happened now… the whole world could go dark?”

The grandfather nodded slowly:
— “Scientists warn it’s possible. If a storm stronger than Carrington hit today, global internet could collapse for days or even weeks. Imagine life without the internet… without communications… without GPS. The world would be thrown into chaos.”

A heavy silence fell. The children imagined the planet plunged into sudden darkness. As the fire flickered, the grandfather lifted his gaze to the sky:
— “That’s why studying space weather isn’t a luxury… it’s a necessity. These storms can change the course of life in an instant.”

A cold breeze swept through, and the children huddled closer. The old man’s eyes glistened as he whispered:
“See this beauty? Behind it lies incredible power… power born from the Sun itself.”

The kids exchanged puzzled looks, until one little girl asked softly:
— “What makes the lights so strong, Grandpa?”

He smiled:
— “It’s because of massive solar storms. The Sun doesn’t only send light and heat. Sometimes, it explodes and hurls enormous clouds of charged particles—Coronal Mass Ejections, or CMEs. When they reach Earth, they shake the magnetic field violently. That’s when the aurora becomes brighter, stronger, and reaches far beyond the poles.”

The children gasped, and the older boy asked seriously:
— “But isn’t that dangerous?”

The grandfather nodded:
— “Exactly. The more beautiful the aurora, the stronger the storm behind it. These storms can damage satellites, shut down GPS, and even overload power grids. In 1989, Canada experienced a massive blackout for hours… all caused by a solar storm.”

The children gasped again, finally realizing the sky wasn’t just beauty—it carried danger too.

The grandfather smiled, seeing their wonder and fear, and added:
— “That’s why studying solar storms is so important. NASA scientists monitor the Sun constantly, tracking every eruption and calculating its speed. This way, they can warn the world before danger strikes.”

He polished his glasses, then leaned forward, his voice calm but heavy:
— “Children… solar storms are not just a pretty sight. Their impact on Earth is enormous.”

One of the girls raised her brows:
— “Like how? Like rain and lightning?”

The grandfather chuckled gently:
— “Not exactly. But they affect the things we use every day. Satellites that give us internet and GPS can be scrambled or shut down. Planes may be rerouted to protect passengers. Power grids can fail, as in the 1989 blackout. And astronauts face the highest risk—exposed to deadly radiation in space.”

The kids exchanged nervous glances. For the first time, they felt that the sky was not just stars and colors, but secrets and hidden forces.

The old man clasped his hands with a reassuring smile:
— “But don’t be afraid, my dears. There are scientists working night and day to protect us. Do you know who?”

All the children shouted together:
— “NASA!”

The grandfather laughed:
— “Exactly! NASA is like Earth’s guardian. They have satellites—like DSCOVR—that constantly watch the Sun. These satellites capture solar explosions and send data back immediately.”

Salma’s eyes sparkled:
— “And what do they do with that data?”

The grandfather leaned forward:
— “They analyze it, just like a doctor reading X-rays. If they see a storm heading toward Earth, they send warnings to governments, airlines, and power companies. Planes change their routes early, power grids prepare, and astronauts move to safe zones.”

Ahmed exclaimed:
— “So NASA is like a shield for Earth?”

The old man pointed upward:
— “Yes. Without monitoring, we’d never know what the Sun sends our way. But now we can predict, prepare, and reduce the damage. And the aurora you see? It’s not just a natural show—it’s a warning light. Scientists call it the ‘language of the sky’—a message of the Sun’s power.”

The children stared in awe, realizing the lights were not only beauty… but science and protection too.

After a pause, little Layla whispered:
— “So these colors… they’re not just decoration?”

The grandfather nodded slowly:
— “Exactly, Layla. The aurora is like a masterpiece, but also a warning. The brighter the colors, the stronger the solar storm behind them. The aurora is nature’s alarm bell, telling scientists: a storm has arrived.”

Salma giggled:
— “So the aurora is both beautiful and a warning!”

The old man chuckled:
— “Yes, it’s magic and science combined. Every time we see it, we must remember—it’s not only a sky painting… it’s a sign of the Sun’s immense power.”

The children fell silent, gazing at the lights as though reading a glowing message. The air was filled with awe—beauty mixed with warning.

Later, as they sat again by the fire, the grandfather spoke softly but firmly:
— “You know, tonight wasn’t only about beauty. We learned the Sun is not just warmth and light, but a force of nature called Space Weather. A force that can change life in a single moment.”

Ahmed frowned:
— “So should we be afraid of it, Grandpa?”

The old man smiled warmly:
— “Not afraid… but aware. Science is the key. NASA and scientists around the world study space weather day and night, predicting storms and giving warnings. That’s what keeps us safe.”

Layla looked at the glowing sky and whispered with a smile:
— “So every time we see the aurora, it’s both a warning… and a gift from nature.”

The grandfather’s eyes sparkled:
— “Exactly. The aurora is the perfect example that beauty can come with danger, and science is what allows us to understand and face it. Without curiosity and questions like yours, we’d never know the truth hidden behind those lights.”

And as the children slowly drifted to sleep, the aurora kept dancing above the small cabin—an eternal blend of beauty and warning, a reminder that science is the only guardian between us and the secrets of the Sun.`;

    Before Anything Existed                
Imagine a time before time—a moment when there was no sky, no ground, no light, no darkness, no sound, no quiet. There was no place to stand, because place didn’t exist. There was no yesterday, no tomorrow, not even a now. It was as if reality hadn’t started its play yet, and the stage, actors, and script were all missing. But hidden in this endless nothing was a tiny point—far smaller than anything the human mind can picture. It was tightly packed with unimaginable energy. If the universe was a storybook, this tiny point was the first letter before the pages were written.

A Seed Holding a Universe
This tiny point wasn’t just small—it was impossibly small. All the space, matter, and energy that would one day become stars, planets, oceans, and living creatures were squished inside it. Think of a seed: inside it hides a whole tree waiting to grow. But this seed was even more powerful. It held the ingredients of everything that would ever exist. It sat silently in the nothingness, filled with pressure so powerful that no words could describe it. Scientists later called this point a singularity, but in our story, it was the universe’s secret beginning.
The Moment Everything Changed
Then, without warning, something extraordinary happened. The tiny point didn’t explode outward like fireworks—instead, space itself began stretching rapidly. Faster than any speed we know, the universe expanded in all directions. Time switched on. Distances formed. The first fractions of a second brought more change than billions of years would later bring. This moment is known as the Big Bang, the event that launched the universe into existence. It wasn’t a bang in the usual sense—it was creation unfolding at impossible speed.

 A Universe of Blinding Heat
Right after the Big Bang, the universe was incredibly hot—trillions of degrees. Everything was pure energy swirling chaotically. Nothing could settle. Nothing could rest. Even the simplest particles couldn’t survive more than a moment before being smashed apart again. It was like a giant cosmic soup boiling violently. But as the universe expanded, the wild energy slowly cooled. The boiling storm softened, though it was still unimaginably hot.

 The First Particles Appear
As the temperature dropped, energy began transforming into tiny building blocks: protons, neutrons, and electrons. These particles danced through space, bumping into one another. Most of them were hydrogen and helium pieces—the simplest materials in the universe. They floated freely, scattered everywhere. Even though they were unimaginably small, these particles were the first steps toward forming everything we see today.

 The Universe Becomes Transparent
For hundreds of thousands of years, the young universe was a glowing fog. Light couldn’t travel far because particles kept blocking it. But as expansion continued, particles cooled enough to join together. Electrons settled into orbits around protons, forming complete atoms. Suddenly, light was free to move. The universe became transparent. A faint glow of this ancient light still exists today—scientists call it the cosmic microwave background, a picture of the universe when it was a baby.

Gravity Begins Its Work
Even in the quiet, gravity was working nonstop. Gravity pulled atoms together, slowly forming bigger and bigger clouds. These clouds stretched across enormous distances. Over millions of years, the clumps grew heavier. Gravity tightened its grip, squeezing the clouds into dense centers. The more matter gathered, the stronger gravity became, pulling in even more material.

 The First Stars Ignite
At the heart of these huge clouds, pressure and temperature rose. When the centers became hot enough, atoms fused together in powerful reactions—and the first stars lit up. Suddenly, the universe had light sources shining everywhere. These stars were giant—much larger and brighter than most stars we see today. They burned fiercely, creating new elements deep in their cores. For the first time, the dark universe sparkled.

 Stars Create the Building Blocks of Life
Inside stars, incredible reactions turned simple hydrogen into heavier elements. Carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, iron—these essential ingredients didn’t exist before. When massive stars grew old, they exploded in spectacular events called supernovae. These explosions spread precious elements across space like seeds on the wind. Every piece of metal, every drop of water, every breath of air on Earth came from stars that lived and died long before our solar system formed. We are, in a very real sense, made of stars.

 Galaxies Form from Star Families
Stars did not wander alone. Gravity grouped them into huge families called galaxies. Millions, then billions of stars spiraled together, forming the cosmic cities of the universe. Our galaxy, the **Milky Way, took shape as a swirling spiral with long glowing arms. Inside one peaceful arm of this galaxy, another cloud of gas and dust was slowly beginning to change—it was preparing to form our Sun.

A Cloud Becomes a Solar System
A giant cloud within the Milky Way started to collapse under its own gravity. As it collapsed, it spun faster, forming a rotating disk. At the center, matter squeezed so tightly that nuclear reactions ignited—creating a brand-new star: the Sun. The remaining dust and gas in the disk clumped together. Small grains stuck, forming rocks. Rocks collided, forming larger bodies. Slowly, the planets began to form.

 Earth and Its Neighbors Are Born
Planets took shape in different ways. Mercury stayed small and rocky. Jupiter grew huge and filled with gas. Saturn formed icy rings. But Earth formed at just the right distance from the Sun—not too hot, not too cold. At first, Earth was a molten ball of fire. Volcanoes erupted everywhere. Meteors crashed onto the surface. Slowly, the planet cooled. Rain fell for thousands of years, forming oceans. The atmosphere thickened. Conditions for life were beginning to appear.

 Life Begins Its Long Journey
In the warm oceans, simple molecules combined into the first tiny living cells. These microscopic pioneers were the beginning of everything alive today. Over billions of years, life grew more complex. Plants filled the oceans, then the land. Creatures crawled out of the sea. Dinosaurs roamed for millions of years. After they disappeared, mammals rose. Every new form of life continued the grand story that began with the Big Bang.

 Humans Join the Story
Much later, humans appeared. They learned to walk upright, make tools, build homes, and explore their world. Unlike any other animal, humans wondered about their place in the universe. They studied the stars, invented telescopes, discovered physics, and asked the question: Where did everything come from? Their search led them back through time, past galaxies, past stars, all the way to the Big Bang. Humanity became the universe becoming aware of itself.

 The Universe Still Grows Today
The Big Bang wasn’t the end of the story—it was the beginning. Even now, the universe continues expanding. Galaxies drift farther apart. New stars are born. Old stars die. Space grows larger every moment. And you, living on a small blue planet orbiting a bright star, are part of this vast story. From a tiny point came everything that exists. The universe isn’t just around you—you are made of it. And its story continues every day, written in the stars above you.

The Quiet Spaces Between the Stars
In the vast darkness of space, between the shining stars and spinning planets, there are giant clouds stretching across unimaginable distances. These clouds are not like the ones above Earth—they are made of gas, dust, and tiny particles floating softly through the emptiness. At first glance, they may seem silent and empty, but inside them, entire worlds are waiting to be born. These magical, colorful, mysterious places are called nebulae.

What a Nebula Really Is
A nebula is a huge cloud made mostly of hydrogen and helium, the simplest elements in the universe. Mixed into it are tiny specks of dust, smaller than grains of sand. Some nebulae are calm and gentle, spread thinly across light‑years. Others are thick, glowing like cosmic fog lit from within. Each nebula holds secrets—new stars, collapsing clouds, swirling colors, and the remains of ancient suns.

The Birth of a Nebula
Nebulae can form in different ways. Some are born when old stars die and scatter their outer layers into space. Others come from leftover material from the early universe, drifting silently for billions of years. When powerful supernova explosions occur, they send shockwaves that push gas together, forming brand‑new nebulae. Each nebula begins as a gentle cloud, waiting for gravity to whisper its next command.

Colors Painted by the Universe
Many nebulae shine with incredible colors—reds, blues, greens, and purples that stretch like giant murals across space. These colors come from energy. When nearby stars shine, their light excites the gas, making it glow. Hydrogen glows red, oxygen glows green or blue, and dust shines in gold and brown. No artist could paint something so huge or so beautiful; the universe paints its own masterpieces.

The Calm Before Creation
Inside a nebula, most places are cold and quiet. Gas floats gently, barely moving. Dust drifts like snowflakes in slow motion. But hidden inside these calm regions are tiny disturbances—areas where the gas becomes just a little thicker. Gravity notices. It begins to pull. Slowly, silently, the nebula starts to change.

Gravity’s First Touch
As gravity pulls the gas together, clumps begin to form. The more the gas gathers, the heavier the clump becomes, and the stronger gravity pulls. What begins as a small pocket of dense gas becomes a growing sphere. This process can take millions of years, but space is patient. The nebula doesn’t rush. It simply transforms.

A Protostar Begins to Form
Inside the densest clumps, temperatures rise. Pressure increases. The gas squeezes tighter and tighter. At the center, a warm core appears—a protostar, the baby stage of a star. It doesn’t shine yet, but it glows faintly with heat. Around it, the nebula swirls like a giant cradle, protecting the newborn star.

The Star Awakens
Millions of years pass. The core grows hotter and heavier. Finally, when the temperature reaches millions of degrees, the atoms inside begin to fuse. Hydrogen atoms merge into helium, releasing massive amounts of energy. In that instant, the protostar becomes a real star, shining its first brilliant light. The nebula around it glows even brighter as the star’s radiation spreads through it.

Nebulae as Star Nurseries
Nebulae that form stars are often called stellar nurseries. In these magical regions, dozens—sometimes hundreds—of stars can be born together. Some grow into giant blue stars that burn hot and fast. Others become smaller yellow stars like our Sun. Many form planets, moons, and entire solar systems. In the quiet heart of a nebula, new worlds begin.

Planetary Systems From Dust
The dust around a newborn star forms a spinning disk. Dust grains collide and stick together. Tiny rocks grow into mountain‑sized objects. Over millions of years, these pieces build planets. Gas giants form far from the star, while rocky planets form closer. Everything—from mountains to oceans to the air we breathe—begins from the dust inside a nebula.

When Stars Shape Their Nebulae
Young stars can be powerful. Their light pushes gas away. Their winds carve shapes—pillars, waves, and arches. Some stars explode, sending shockwaves that sculpt the nebula into new forms. Nebulae are not still pictures—they constantly grow, stretch, twist, and reshape, like cosmic sculptures made of starlight and shadow.

Nebulae Made From Dying Stars
Not all nebulae create stars. Some form when stars reach the end of their lives. A small star may puff out its outer layers, forming a glowing shell called a planetary nebula. These shells glow beautifully before fading away. Large stars may explode as supernovae, scattering their material across space. The remains become colorful supernova remnants—bright, chaotic clouds filled with heavy elements.

The Cycle of Cosmic Life
Nebulae tell the story of the universe’s recycling system. Old stars die, spreading their elements. Nebulae gather those elements. New stars and planets form from the same materials. Every atom in your body—your bones, your blood, your breath—was once inside a nebula. You are part of this cosmic cycle, connected to stars that lived billions of years ago.

Famous Nebulae Across the Sky
Some nebulae are so beautiful that astronomers study them for years.

The Orion Nebula glows like a giant winged cloud, filled with newborn stars.

The Eagle Nebula holds the famous Pillars of Creation, towering shapes carved by starlight.

The Crab Nebula is the remains of a supernova seen from Earth a thousand years ago.

The Carina Nebula is a storm of gas and dust, one of the biggest star nurseries known.
Each nebula is like a chapter of the universe’s story.

The Nebula’s Endless Story
Nebulae are never truly finished. They appear, change, stretch, collapse, and fade over millions of years. Even now, somewhere in the universe, a new star is beginning to form inside a quiet cloud of gas. Somewhere else, a dying star is creating a nebula of its own. And you, looking up at the night sky, are watching the same universe that has been creating and recreating itself for billions of years. Nebulae remind us that creation is ongoing—one endless cosmic story told in light, dust, and time.`;

In a small observatory on a quiet hill, a young astronomer named Arin spent her nights watching the stars. But something always puzzled her. The galaxies she observed were spinning too fast—so fast that they should’ve flown apart. Yet they didn’t. Something unseen was holding everything together, a hidden force weaving through the cosmos.

The Strange Discovery
One night, Arin noticed something odd: stars on the edges of a distant galaxy were moving as quickly as those near the center. "This isn’t possible," she whispered. "Something… invisible must be holding them together." The thought made her heart race. What could it be?

The Visitor of Shadows
As she stared through her telescope, a faint shadowy figure appeared beside her—soft, glowing outlines, like a ghost made of starlight. "Do not be afraid," it said. "I am Umbra, a messenger of the unseen. I have come to show you what binds the universe."

The Hidden Web
Umbra touched the telescope gently, and the sky around Arin changed. Suddenly, she could see threads—thin, glowing lines—stretching between galaxies like an enormous cosmic spiderweb. "This," Umbra said, "is the Dark Matter Web. It holds galaxies together and shapes the cosmos quietly."

The Galaxy Puzzle
Umbra guided her closer to a galaxy. She saw countless stars spinning rapidly, yet the galaxy stayed whole. "Dark Matter is everywhere," Umbra explained, "even though you cannot see it. It pushes and pulls, shaping everything and keeping order in the vast universe."

The Invisible Hand
Arin reached toward one of the glowing threads. Her hand passed through it, but she felt a slight vibration—as if something powerful and ancient surrounded her. "Dark Matter doesn’t shine, doesn’t glow, but its gravity is strong. It is the universe’s invisible hand, pulling galaxies together."

The Floating Islands
Umbra took her deeper. She saw clusters of galaxies floating like islands connected by invisible bridges. "Without Dark Matter," Umbra said, "these islands would drift apart. The universe would be quiet… empty. It is Dark Matter that gives the universe its shape."

The Dark Rivers
Then she saw massive cosmic rivers of invisible material flowing between galaxies. "Dark Matter forms the highways of the universe," Umbra told her. "Galaxies travel along these rivers, gathering where Dark Matter gathers. Every star you see relies on this invisible structure."

The Missing Piece
Arin noticed something strange—no matter how much she looked, she never saw Dark Matter directly. "We cannot see you," she told Umbra. "How do we know you’re real?"

Umbra smiled. "You know me by my influence. When something is missing, but its effects are everywhere—you understand its truth."

The Silent Guardian
Umbra showed Arin a simulation of the early universe—a swirling fog moments after the Big Bang. Dark Matter formed first, gathering into shapes that would later pull gas and stars together. "I am the skeleton of the cosmos," Umbra said softly. "Without me, nothing would form."

The Dance of Gravity
Arin watched as galaxies danced around Dark Matter centers. "So you’re the choreographer," she said with a smile. "You create the dance steps, and the stars follow. Each galaxy spins in perfect harmony because of you."

The Hidden Majority
"Your universe is mostly me," Umbra said. "Dark Matter makes up over 80 percent of all matter. Yet humans have only just begun to notice."

Arin felt small—but also full of wonder. "We’ve been studying the universe for centuries," she whispered, "but we’ve been missing most of it."

The Unseen Forces
Umbra guided her to a giant cluster where galaxies orbited something invisible. "One day," Umbra said, "your people will find a way to detect me directly. But for now, you see my footprints in the stars. You can measure my gravity, but you cannot touch me."

The Return
As dawn approached, Umbra began to fade. "Remember," he said, "the universe is more than what your eyes can see. The greatest mysteries live in the shadows. Keep watching, keep questioning. One day, you may reveal more than anyone imagined."

Arin blinked—and found herself back in her observatory. The sky was quiet again, but her mind was alive with new understanding.

The Silent Sky
Between the stars, between the galaxies, she could feel the presence of something enormous and silent. She whispered, "I know you're there, Umbra. And I’ll keep searching for you."

The stars seemed to shimmer, as if the shadows themselves were smiling back. And Arin knew she had glimpsed the hidden skeleton of the universe—the invisible matter that held it all together.
