# Static copy of Space Stories

This folder contains a static (plain HTML/CSS/JS) copy of the main pages from the Next.js project.

Files:
- `index.html` — landing page
- `stories.html` — stories list
- `story-aurora-nights.html` — full story detail page
- `about.html` — about page
- `assets/styles.css` — styles for the static site
- `assets/script.js` — small JS for animations (starfield, mini-orbits, nav)

To run locally:

```powershell
cd 'e:\Codes\Next\space-stories\static-clone'
python -m http.server 3000
# open http://localhost:3000
```

If you want additional stories converted to static pages, tell me which ones and I'll add them.
